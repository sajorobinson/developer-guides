# DRAFT - Design and generate an API with OpenAPI, TypeScript, and Express

Want to design an API and auto-generate code to start development?

This guide walks you through:

1. The basics of an OpenAPI file.
2. Generating code stubs from an OpenAPI file.
3. Implementing a basic endpoint to show how an API is structured.

## Overview

[OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org) is a standard for describing RESTful APIs in a machine-readable format. It's a blueprint that defines every aspect of an API, including:

- Routes
- Parameters
- Responses
- Authentication methods
- And more

An OpenAPI file is like a contract between a client (a user of your API) and the server hosting your API that.

### Why use OpenAPI?

Why exactly should you use an OpenAPI file?

- **Clarity**: Both humans and machines can understand your API.
- **Consistency**: Reduces guesswork across teams.
- **Automation**: Enables code generation, testing, and documentation.

We'll go into more depth about the benefits to automation an OpenAPI file provides, but don't underestimate (especially if you're making enterprise software) the benefit of **clarity** and **consistency**. It's common for multiple teams to interact with an API. Your users could include:

- Customer Success Managers
- Developers
- QA testers
- Sales Engineers
- Support Engineers

Having a single source of truth of what your API can do makes it easier for everyone to get on the same page of how to use the API.

### Docs-first API design

Instead of coding an API first and documenting it later, a **docs-first approach** starts with the OpenAPI spec. This ensures the API design is thoughtful, consistent, and reviewable before implementation.

We'll be taking a docs-first approach in this guide.

### Code generation

OpenAPI can generate code automatically for you:

- **Server stubs**: Skeleton code for your API backend, letting you focus on logic rather than boilerplate. This allows you to create workflows where modifications to your OpenAPI file result in autogenerated code you can more easily connect to custom logic.
- **SDKs/clients**: Ready-to-use code for consuming your API in different languages. You can distribute an SDK to users of your API.

## 1: Create your OpenAPI file

- Start from a template
- Explain structure and maintainability choices

## 2: Install and configure `openapi-generator-cli`

- Installation via npm
- Minimal config for our needs

## 3: Generate the server stub and SDK

- Run generation command
- Review the generated structure and files

## 4: Implement an endpoint

- Add real logic to one generated route
- Show how the generated interfaces help with type safety

## 5: Test the endpoint

- Use Postman (or cURL) to send requests and verify responses

## 6: Recap whatâ€™s now possible

- Next steps (connecting data sources, adding more endpoints)
